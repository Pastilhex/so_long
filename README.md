So Long is part of a set of exercises presented by school 42 during the course called Common Core.

The project consists of developing a game in C language using a MinilibX library. 

"The MinilibX is a small C library used for rendering graphics, primarily used by 42 students. This library is built on top of the X Window System API, to provide a much simpler programming interface suited for beginners. Indeed, no X knowledge is needed at all to render graphics properly using this kind of library."
